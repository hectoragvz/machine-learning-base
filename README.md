# Machine Learning before Deep Leanring

A quick guide through the resources needed to face deeplearning. As reviewd in [here](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp/).

## Main types of ML

1. Supervised learning (data with labels)

  * Classification (binary or multiclass)
  * Regression (predicting a number)

2. Unsupervised learning (data with no labels)

3. Transfer learning (after deeplearning)

  * Existing models applied to different problems

4. Reinforcement learning (after deeplearning)

  * Teaching machines via 'rewards' and 'punishments'
