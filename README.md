# Machine Learning before Deep Leanring

A quick guide through the resources needed to face deeplearning. As reviewd in [here](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp/).

## The Tech Stack to Explore

I prefer experimenting with Jupyter notebooks via VScode. In this way, you only worry about setting up a Python virtual environment and installing the needed dependencies. 

However, the key here is to know your own setup and understand the source of the power you are getting via GPUs provided. Kaggle Notebooks and Google Collabs work best. 

1. Pandas: Important for data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Numpy: The backbone of all kinds of scientific and numerical computing in Python
3. Matplotlib: To visualize data via plots 
4. Scikit Learn: The most used machine learning library

Review the included notebooks to get familiar with the basic stack you need to know to get into ML.
